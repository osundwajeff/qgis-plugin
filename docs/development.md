Recommending to use [virtualenv-wrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

It can be installed using python pip 

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

 1. Create virtual environment

    ```
    mkvirtualenv geosys
    ```

2. Using the pip, install plugin development dependencies by running 

    ```
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

3. Install an automatic code formatting hook using the following command, 
   this will run code style checks each time a commit is created.
    ```
    pre-commit install
    ```
   Run the following pre-commit command after installing the pre-commit hook
   for the first time.
   ```
    pre-commit run --all-files

#### Plugin admin interface
The plugin contains a script that can be used for various development tasks.

Generate a plugin zip file using the below command, after a successful run the plugin zip file will be located
on the `dist` folder under the plugin root folder.

```
python admin.py generate-zip
```

### üîß Testing

The plugin currently support running tests on Linux environment only, to run plugin tests use the below script
from the plugin root.
```
   ./run-docker-tests.sh
```

The script builds a testable plugin code and then it spins up Docker containers that contain QGIS version 3.10 and 3.26 
 images respectively, finally it runs the available test suite. Python is required to
be installed in the system before using the script.

When using the script for the first time it will pull the QGIS Docker images if there are not available 
locally. After the tests have finished running the Docker containers created for the tests will be stopped and removed.
